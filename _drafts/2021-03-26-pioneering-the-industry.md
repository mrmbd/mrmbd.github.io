# Pioneering the industry

**Basis**

There are 2 types of jobs you can go for either 9-5 fixed income jobs or freelance jobs. Both have their pros and cons. We, the founders of Bombay Studio, experienced both and now want to create a “best-of-both-worlds-experience” for our employees.

*We are very flexible and remote but still strongly connected with one another.*


**Training**

![Level 1](/img/posts/level1.jpeg)

Unlike other companies we are always approachable and ready to teach new skills to people who are interested in joining us. This offer really is open to anyone interested.
We acknowledge that everyone has a different pace of learning. But, on average, people with no prior experience in Shopify, but with front end experience take **3 months** to be fully trained. People with no front end experience take approximately **1 year** to be fully trained.

**Training Guidelines:**

- During the training period, people are not taught one-on-one. Instead they are given feedback on how they perform on the very well defined task that we provide them with. They are guided and told what they could do next to make their code world class and production ready.
- We want to find people who are willing to solve problems on their own. People who are capable of doing a little research on the problems that they are confronted with, showing that they are interested in solving the problem at hand.
- Obviously, the level of the “training tasks” grows more and more complex. It ranges from “easy” for beginners and gradually increases in difficulty to “advanced”. When the “advanced” level is reached people are ready to become a full fledged employee of the company. Again, feedback will be given on how to make the task perfect.
- If you successfully complete 5 tasks on time during the training period you will be promoted to an employee. There’s no salary in training period but a joining bonus of 1 month will be paid if you join us as an employee (which will be paid along with year completion bonus)
- The code you write for your training tasks can be shown on your portfolio and you can use it for your own projects but you can't sell it or implement it in any other organisation without our prior permission. It is very important that you understand that we retain full ownership of any code written/submitted while in training.


**Level 1 -  Employee**

![Level 2](/img/posts/level2.png)

In this stage you are given a real project that you get to tackle head on. Bombay studio strives to give their clients the best service and aims to go above and beyond to help them improve their business and all our employees must share the same mindset.
We have already worked on lots of projects and thus have built out an extensive knowledge base that you can consult and reference. Next to that our senior level employees and managers are always ready to guide you whenever you face a hurdle that requires some help to scale.


**Level 1 -  Employee Guidelines:**

- Employees are paid based on the tasks and hours assigned to the tasks. Tasks are small chunks of work that are easy to track and manage. All the “tasks” together form the “project”.
- Every employee is given at least € 600 worth of tasks per month. If Bombay fails to assign tasks worth € 600 and the employee has completed all its tasks on time then € 600 is paid to the employee anyway.
Employees also have a chance to make much more than € 600 if they perform because if this is the case they are shifted to bigger projects. In these projects the stakes will be higher but so will be the rewards.
- For the first two years 40% salary will be retained by Bombay. The retained part will be partially released after having completed 1 year of working with Bombay. On top of the release of retained funds you’ll get a 15% bonus on completion of that 1 year. The rest of the retained amount will be released after having worked 2 years for Bombay. Again, a 15% bonus will be given on top of the retained amount. After 2 years there won’t be any salary retainments anymore and you’ll just get your full salary every single month! As an example to make everything as transparent as possible: Your wage is € 600 / month. We retain 40% of that amount meaning you get € 360 cas, paid out each month. Meaning that we hold € 240 every month. At the end of year one that amounts to 12 * € 240 = € 2880. If we add the 15% bonus on top of that € 2880 * 1,15 = € 3312. 50% of this amount will be paid out on the day you’ll receive your 12th salary. Meaning that date you’ll get € 360 + € 1656 = € 2016. The rest of the retained amount will be paid out after having worked 24 months for Bombay. This means that you get the following amount on your 24th salary € 360 + € 1656 (from your first year’s retainments) + € 3312 (second year retainments + 15%) = € 5328 on that day.
- On before time delivery you will get a 5% bonus on task payment, and on delayed delivery depending on how long it took you will get deducted 5% upto to 20% and along with 20% deduction you will get a warning. Never decline tasks, only on leave or for serious emergencies you can decline tasks. But intentionally declining or purposefully not doing tasks will result in a warning and after 3 such warnings you will be terminated and the retained money with us will not be released.

*rules are subject to change without prior notice and by starting as a trainee you have read all the guidelines above and agreed to them.*
