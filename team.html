            It all started in 2015 when a group of friends launched their first e-commerce business. A direct-to-consumer ergonomic furniture brand.<br><br>
             We scaled the product and business in Europe and after a couple of years partnered up with Fully, an American B-Corp. We had so much fun together they decided to acquire us. After the acquisition we launched and grew the Fully brand throughout Europe from € 100+k  to a couple of million a month.<br><br>
             During that period several smaller brands started to contact us to ask if we couldn’t help them scale as well. Bombay was born.

            To make a good product, you have to collaborate with lots of people, each with their own knowledge. We want this to run as smoothly as possible so we choose our team en clients carefully. The communication has to be honest and to the point. Trust is given but can be taken away.

            It’s all about the money, everybody knows this. In the beginning just enough to live off, and hopefully after a while enough to have fun with live.<br><br> Because money isn’t everything, we make it a point to donate to causes we stand behind, with sticker pets, a part of the profits go to ….?

            We love beautiful things, we are drawn to them. If we build a website/shop for your beautiful product it’s going to be a mix of good UX and beautiful UI. User experience is important but a good design isn’t everything. It’s has to be pretty and trustworthy too.
