            We are a group of business optimists around the world, who want to help your company flourish!<br><br>
             It all started in 2015, a group of friends launched their first e-commerce. We designed, manufactured and sold a standing desk. We set up a successful crowdfunding campaign and put our souls into it.<br><br>
              After we scaled the product throughout Europe, we had the opportunity to work with an American company, Fully. Not long after we got acquired by Fully, we launched and grew the Fully brand throughout Europe. (€ 100+k -> € 5+ Mio)<br><br>
               After that, we started helping several smaller online first brands in our leisure time. We found awesome people to collaborate with around the world.<br><br>
                We got good at what we did and loved doing it, so the decision to start our own company was easy. Bombay was born.

            To make a good product, you have to collaborate with lots of people, each with their own knowledge. We want this to run as smoothly as possible so we choose our team en clients carefully. The communication has to be honest and to the point. Trust is given but can be taken away.

            It’s all about the money, everybody knows this.

            We love beautiful things, we are drawn to them. If we build a website/shop for your beautiful product it’s going to be a mix of good UX and beautiful UI. User experience is important but a good design isn’t everything. It’s has to be pretty and trustworthy too.
