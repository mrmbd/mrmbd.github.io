**Fill out the interview form from the link given below.**
<a href="https://forms.gle/nYHUazavQsbnuHom6" target="_blank">https://forms.gle/nYHUazavQsbnuHom6</a>


**Simple website “block” implementation test**

- Create a shopify partner account if you don’t have one already.
- Add a development/testing store where you have to build a section.
- Create a new section “testimonials” based on the design given below <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/bca0c2a9-c90e-4846-b549-57e569dcee08-e9f3/" target="_blank">https://xd.adobe.com/view/bca0c2a9-c90e-4846-b549-57e569dcee08-e9f3/</a> you can check the spec tab in the XD to check all the fonts used, style information, spacing, copy text and download any asset images.
- The section should be customisable in the following way: we can add testimonial blocks from the customise menu.
![testimonial blocks](/img/posts/pasted image 0.png)
- Each block should have two editable fields for body and name
![testimonial blocks 2](/img/posts/pasted image 1.png)
- Design wise the testimonials should be a carousel when clicking the right/left arrows next/previous testimonials should slide in.(My suggestion is to use slick slider)
- All the css for this section should be written by you.
- After the completion of this task you’ll have to add me to your development store with proper permissions so that I can verify your work. (Settings>Account>Staff account). I’m Mihir Dave, [mihir@bombay-studio.com](mailto:mihir@bombay-studio.com)
- You can [email](mailto:mihir@bombay-studio.com) me at the same address if you have any doubts regarding the test.

So please make sure you **complete both** the tests before that and [Email](mailto:mihir@bombay-studio.com) me after completion so I can verify.

If we are happy with your work we’ll contact you on your email address given in part 1 of interview. **All the best**.
